# Jenkinsfiles

A collection of Jenkins pipeline definitions (Jenkinsfiles) and CI/CD snippets maintained by @amoncadap.

This repository is intended as a central place to store reusable pipeline patterns, example pipelines for common workflows, and documentation to help teams adopt or adapt Jenkins Declarative and Scripted pipelines.

## Contents
- Jenkinsfiles/ — example pipeline definitions organized by project, language, or purpose.
- templates/ — reusable pipeline snippets or shared-library-style examples.
- docs/ — guidance, conventions, and examples for using the pipelines.

## Overview
Each Jenkinsfile demonstrates a specific CI/CD flow (build, test, package, and/or deploy). Files are organized to be copy-pasted into a project's repository root or used as references when writing new pipelines.

Typical pipeline concerns covered:
- Multi-stage Declarative pipelines
- Parallel test stages
- Docker build and publish stages
- Environment-specific deployment stages
- Integration with credentials and secure variables
- Notifications (Slack/email) and post-build steps

## Usage
- Copy a Jenkinsfile from this repository into your project's root and adjust stage steps and environment values for your project.
- Replace example credentials and secrets with Jenkins Credentials referenced by ID.
- If using Docker agents or custom tools, ensure the Jenkins agents have the required runtime and plugins installed.

Example quick-start:
1. Copy `Jenkinsfiles/example-pipeline` to your repo as `Jenkinsfile`.
2. Change any pipeline environment variables and credential IDs.
3. Create or update a Jenkins job (Multibranch or Pipeline) to use the repository.

## Conventions & Recommendations
- Use declarative pipelines for readability unless you need advanced scripted behavior.
- Keep secrets out of the repository; reference them by Jenkins Credentials IDs.
- Use stages and stage-level `when` conditions to gate environment-specific steps.
- Prefer small, focused stages to make logs and failures easier to diagnose.
- Tag and push artifacts (Docker images, packages) only from protected branches.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome:
- Add new Jenkinsfiles, templates, or small utilities that improve pipeline maintainability.
- When adding a pipeline, include a short description and any required plugins, credentials, or external services.
- Open a pull request and include usage notes and testing steps.

## Security & Compliance
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, or private keys.
- Document any required Jenkins plugins and minimal permissions for service accounts used by pipelines.
- Audit pipeline steps that perform deployments or modify production systems.
